        "en": "Östberg is using the Eurovent standards to calculate the thermal efficiency based on the supply temperature and the extract temperature. This algorithm can lead to overly optimistic results in low-end and leaky units. The PHI (Passivhaus Institut) uses a more accurate algorithm based on the extract temperature and the exhaust temperature. Enabling this option might cause the thermal efficiency to be lower than the readings on the remote."
