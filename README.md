# Östberg Heru

## What

Control your Östberg Heru ventilation system with Homey Pro.

## Why

-   Set your ventilation system to away mode automatically when you leave the house.
-   Lower heating during the night.
-   Get notified when alarms become active or reset
-   Automatically turn on boost mode when showering
-   ... and more

## How

### Gen 3 with Remote

Make sure you system first has modbus enabled from the remote by going to the _Service menu_ and log in with the code 1199. If you don't see a setting for Modbus it means you have to first buy a new remote with modbus and pair it to your ventilation system to enable the modbus.

When modbus is enabled you need a TCP/IP to RS485 converter to connect to your Heru unit. I have personally confirmed it working with two different types:

-   Moxa NPORT 5232I
-   Ebyte 810-DTU V2 (By far the cheapest, about $20 on ebay)

You need to configure this converter with a IP and a ort that this app will connect to. Connect the three wires (D-/A,D+/B,0/GND) to your ventilation systems Modbus interface port. Make sure the settings on the TCP/IP to RS485 converter matches your ventilation system serial settings.

I am using the following on my system (Heru 100T EC, Gen 3 with the modbus remote):

-   Baud rate: 9600
-   Data bits: 8
-   Parity: none
-   Stop bit: 1

### IQC Touch

TCP/IP directly towards the Heru unit (preferred), or through a TCP/IP to RS485 converter (I have not confirmed that the newer generation have the serial interface still, but the support for it is currently there to be sure).

## General info

Since Östberg has changed naming convention between the Gen 3 and the IQC for Exhaust/Extract/Waste I am following this:

-   Supply: From the unit to the rooms
-   Extract: From the rooms to the unit
-   Waste: From the unit and out of the house
-   Outdoor: From the outside and in to the unit

**Clear alarms** and **Reset filter timer** did not work for me, so the flows for this are left out of the application as of now. If you own a system with the IQC Touch panel and want to test if this could work on your system, please contact me.

I am also getting alarms on **Supply fan** and **Extract fan** during normal operation, Östberg said that it could possibly a incorrect modbus configuration on their side.
